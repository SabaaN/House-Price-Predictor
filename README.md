# House-Price-Predictor:


This is a machine learning project that aims to estimate house prices based on various attributes of houses. The project utilizes a regression-based machine learning model and provides a user-friendly web interface developed using Flask for easy interaction.


The dataset used for training and evaluating the house price prediction model contains various attributes of houses, including square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc
Each house in the dataset is associated with its corresponding price, which serves as the target variable for training the machine learning model. The dataset is split into training and evaluation sets to assess the model's performance accurately.


It employs a regression-based approach to learn the relationships between the house attributes and their prices. The model is trained on the provided dataset to make accurate price predictions for new, unseen houses.


## Front End
The web interface provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the House Price Predictor. Users can input various attributes of a property, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, and the application will display an estimated price based on the trained machine learning model.
